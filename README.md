## Step 1: Define Project Scope and Requirements

### Objective:

Clearly outline the features and functionalities of your simulated trade execution system.

### Activities:

- Identify the types of orders to support (market orders, limit orders, stop orders).
- Specify the risk management features.
- Define the user roles and permissions.
- Determine the data to display on the web-based dashboard.

## Step 2: Choose a Financial Market API

### Objective:

Select a financial market API to simulate real-time market data.

### Activities:

Consider using free or trial versions of financial market APIs for simulated data.
Examples of market data providers include Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or Yahoo Finance.

## Step 3: Set Up Spring Boot Project

### Objective:

Initialize a Spring Boot project for backend development.

### Activities:

Use [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new Spring Boot project.
Include dependencies such as:

- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- WebSocket

## Step 4: Implement User Authentication and Authorization

### Objective:

Create a secure authentication system for users.

### Activities:

- Use Spring Security for user authentication.
- Implement role-based access control to manage permissions.

## Step 5: Integrate with Financial Market API

### Objective:

Fetch simulated real-time market data for display.

### Activities:

- Choose a relevant API based on Step 2.
- Implement a service to fetch market data and update it periodically.

## Step 6: Design Order Management System

### Objective:

Implement a system for managing and executing orders.

### Activities:

- Create an order model with attributes like order type, quantity, and price.
- Implement services to handle order placement, execution, and cancellation.

## Step 7: Implement Concurrency and Low Latency

### Objective:

Apply Java's concurrency utilities to optimize order processing.

### Activities:

- Use features like ExecutorService for managing concurrent tasks.
- Implement mechanisms to minimize latency in order execution.

## Step 8: Develop Risk Management Features

### Objective:

Incorporate risk management to control trade sizes and set risk limits.

### Activities:

- Set predefined risk limits for each user.
- Implement checks to prevent orders that exceed risk limits.

## Step 9: Design Web-based Dashboard

### Objective:

Create a user-friendly dashboard for traders.

### Activities:

- Use Thymeleaf or a frontend framework of your choice for the dashboard.
- Display real-time market data, order book, and portfolio information.

## Step 10: Testing and Documentation

### Objective:

Thoroughly test the application and document your code.

### Activities:

- Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- Document the code, including comments and explanations of key components.

## Step 11: Deployment and Hosting

### Objective:

Deploy the application for public access.

### Activities:

- Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure).
- Deploy the Spring Boot application and configure necessary settings.

## Step 12: Continuous Improvement

### Objective:

Continuously refine and optimize the system based on feedback.

### Activities:

- Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Iterate on the project to address any identified issues or enhancements.

### Important Considerations:

- <b>Simulated Environment:</b> Emphasize that this is a simulated environment for educational and portfolio purposes, and real orders or real money should not be involved.

- <b>Legal and Ethical Considerations:</b> Adhere to legal and ethical standards. Ensure that your simulated system complies with any applicable regulations.

- <b>Security:</b> Prioritize security measures, especially when handling user data and transactions, even in a simulated environment.

By following these steps, you can build a high-performance trade execution system that showcases your Java Spring Boot skills while maintaining a simulated and educational context. Adjust the project's complexity based on your time constraints and the specific requirements you want to highlight in your portfolio.
